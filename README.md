The movie project is the first one I build, I build it because, I couldn't find something that satisfied what I needed to manage my Movies, mainly remembering who had borrowed what. I was tired of getting a movie back thinking, is this mine? I diden´t recall lending it out.
There are some out there of course, if I recall correctly they cost money, and that in itself is fine, but it diden´t suit the way I think, I like open source and I know
Open Source shoulden´t automaticly mean free, Free as in Freedom not as in Free Beer I know.
This project like the others are build to meet my needs, I will continue to work on it if I find new ideas, and I am sure it will take on a life of it own and improve, such is the nature of Open Source.
I have had good use of this for the last few years, I hope you will find it useful as well.
